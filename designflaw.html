    Before disaster :
    Believe it or not, but one of the worlds worst disasters was caused by none other than a safety test. Well, a safety
    test and Soviet secrets, but mainly a safety test. A test to determine if under attack or a black-out that the turbines
    used to keep the reactor cool would have enough inertia to bridge to 70 second gap that the back-up diesel-powered
    generators needed to get up to full speed and keep coolant pumping through the core.
    </p>
    
    <p id="disaster-2">
    There are a few factors that stacked against the plant-operators favour that night, but the biggest would be a lack of
    information. We’ll pick this up later, but a tiny button called “AZ-5” was the trigger behind the bullet.
    </p>


    <p id="disaster-3">
    The test was long overdue, promotions were on the line and Deputy Chief Engineer – Anatoly Dyatlov was not going to let
    another failed test go against his career. Under the control of Viktor Bryukhanov and Nikolai Fomin the test begun.
    However, the conditions of the reactor were not optimal for it to produce any valuable data. The power was too low and
    the reactor was in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine_pit" target="_blank" aria-label="Navigates to a wiki-pedia page explaining what a xenon pit is (Opens in a new page)">”xenon pit”</a>, but the test went ahead anyway. What happened next changed the world and
    unleashed a disaster that would cost the Soviet Union around 230 billion dollars and worse, the deaths of thousands of
    people. The official death toll? 30.

   <!--Countdown to diaster - minute by minute section INCOMPLETE-->
   
   <!--<ul id="countdown">
    
        <li><strong>12:28am -</strong> The reactor is primed for the test, power is reduced to 700 megawatts.</li>
    
        <li><strong>12:31am -</strong> LAC (Local Area Control) is disabled to attempt to bring the power up, this in turn stalls the reactor down to
                                        less than 100megawatts.</li>
    
        <li><strong>12:38 -</strong> 30megawatts, xenon still being created but none burning away. At this state power should be raised slowly over a
                                        24 hr period, Dyatlov insists test is carried on.
                                        Control rods are removed from core in an attempt to raise reactivity and increase power, this doesn’t work so 205 of 211
                                        rods are removed.</li>
   
        <li><strong>1:00am -</strong> Power is now at 200 megawatts.</li>
    
        <li><strong>1:02am -</strong> Pump 4 is started, pipes begin to rattle and jump around. Alarm for steam level in spereator drum sounds.</li>
   
        <li><strong>1:22am -</strong> Yuvchenko (Mechanical engineer) records pipework violently vibrating in the pump room.</li>
    
        <li><strong>1:22:30am -</strong> The reactors SKALA computer system reports “based on the absence of sufficient fuel rods a shut down is
                            recommended”. Dyatlov disregards report and continues test.</li>
    
        <li><strong>1:23:04am -</strong> All pumps to reactor are shut down.</li>
    
        <li><strong>1:23:06am -</strong> Reactivity violently swings in opposite direction – power level increases.</li>
    
        <li><strong>1:23:35am -</strong> power surge is detected in control room.</li>
    
        <li><strong>1:23:40am -</strong> AZ-5 button is pressed.</li>
        
        
        <div>This immediately inserts all control rods into reactor to completely cease reactivity.
    Fully withdran rods move into reactor, the first thing to hit the reactor is the graphite tipped rods. This horrific
    flaw in AZ-5’s design was redacted from all official documentation and hidden from the engineers of Chernobyl. They do
    not know it but by pressing this button they have pulled the trigger. Graphite increases reactivty. Reaction skyrockets.
    Every molecule of water in the reactor instantly converts to steam which explands and ruptures a series of fuel rod
    channels. The controls rods are now stuck, endlessly accelerating the reaction.</div>
        

        <li><strong>1:23:42am -</strong> Perevozchenko looks down into the reactor hall and sees the fuel rod channel caps (each weighing 350kg) are
            jumping up and down in the sockets.</li>
    
        <li><strong>1:23:44am -</strong> Steam blows fuel channels apart.</li>
   
        <li><strong>1:23:45am -</strong> Explosion. The 1000 tonne reactor lid is thrown off, oxygen rushes in to the reactor. Combined with hydrogen and super
            heated graphite, this ignites and blows the roof off Reactor 4 containment building.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    The final reading of Chernobyl Reactor 4, Designed to operate at 3200 megawatts. Went beyond 33000.
