    <h3>What went wrong and who was to blame?</h3>
    <p id="disaster-1">
    Believe it or not, one of the world's worst disasters was caused by none other than a safety test. Well, a safety
    test and Soviet secrets, but mainly a safety test. A test to determine if under attack or a black-out, that the turbines
    used to keep the reactor cool would have enough inertia to bridge the 70 second gap that the back-up diesel-powered
    generators needed to get up to full speed and keep coolant pumping through the core.
    </p>

    <p id="disaster-2">
    There are a few factors that stacked against the plant operator's favour that night, but the biggest would be a lack of
    information. We’ll pick this up later, but a tiny button called “AZ-5” was the trigger behind the bullet.
    </p>

    <p id="disaster-3">
    The test was long overdue, promotions were on the line and Deputy Chief Engineer – Anatoly Dyatlov was not going to let
    another failed test go against his career. Under the control of Viktor Bryukhanov and Nikolai Fomin, the test began.
    However, the conditions of the reactor were not optimal for it to produce any valuable data. The power was too low and
    the reactor was in a <a id="xenon" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine_pit" target="_blank" aria-label="Navigates to a wiki-pedia page explaining what a xenon pit is (Opens in a new page)">”xenon pit”</a>, but the test went ahead anyway. What happened next changed the world and
    unleashed a disaster that would cost the Soviet Union around $230 billion and worse, the deaths of thousands of
    people.

    <p>
      The official Soviet death toll? 30.
