# Chernobyl - A brief history
Chernobyl - A brief history is a quick glimpse into the facts behind the 1986 disaster that turned the local town of Prypiat into a ghost town. The page is for those wanting a quick and easy lesson into what happened and also features a booking form for those looking to tour Prypiat and visit the decommissioned reactor â€“ A must for all urban explorers!

# Features -
 - Navigation bar : Featured at the top of all of the pages is a fully responsive navigation bar with links to the Home page, Disaster page and the Tours page. It is replicated on each page for easy navigation. This allows all users to easily navigate between pages without having to use the browsers back buttons.
 - Landing page : This is where the user begins. This page features a brief run-down of the backstory of the Chernobyl incident as well as an assortment of images of the ghost town of Prypiat as it stands today.
 - Disaster : On the disaster page the user can find a more in-depth look into the disaster, along with a full responsive map of the Chernobyl power station and an embedded video going into even more detail of the accident and how it started.
 - Tours : On the tours page the user can use our simple and easy to use booking form to submit their details to us. The form has interactive buttons, full customisation on where the user would like to visit, a drop-down date selector and verification on all relevant fields.
 - The footer : Fixed along the bottom of each page is the footer. This contain copyright information for the page and links to social media. There is also a link to my Linkedin page.

### Features left to implement -
- An additional page containing information on the clean-up of the exposed reactor and surrounding area.
- A carousel on the bottom of the landing page showing more pictures.

# Testing -
When going through the testing phase, I wanted to ensure the user journey was straightforward, with website visitors being able to navigate through the website at ease and to be able to achieve their desired outcome with a minimal amount of clicks. To achieve this, I have ensured the navigation bar is clear, simple and effortless to use. Navigation headings are clearly named and give a comprehensible indication of what the user can expect when they click. Easy to read font has been used to ensure users can effortlessly view the navigation bar with ease at each stage of their website journey. 

It was essential that the platform was fully responsive so users are able to easily navigate through the website using any device. The simplistic navigation bar is clear and easy to use on a wide range of devices, and each page is easy to use regardless of how you are viewing it. The platform was put through a vigorous testing phase where I used multiple devices and screen sizes. This was to ensure that wherever the user was on their journey through the website, they would be able to get to where they needed to be with a couple of simple clicks. 

On the 'Disaster' page where most of the information sits, copy is kept concise and is complemented with an embedded video and responsive map. I felt it was important to ensure users had a multitude of ways to learn about the disaster to decrease the bounce rate percentage on the page and to ensure the content was accessible and engaging to all users. 

On the 'Tours' landing page, I felt it was important that the enquiry form was simple, easy to use and didn't require the end user to be overwhelmed by options. Because of this, I have kept options to a minimum and ensured there is a simple way for users to clear/restart the form if they need to.

Following my research prior to the project, I wanted to ensure that the website footer was clear and concise but also didn't impact the overall user experience on the website. Because of this, I chose to limit the contents of the footer and kept options to a minimum. The footer includes copyright information and links to my social platforms where users can further enquire about the website, it's content and the tours. 

### Bugs -
- When viewing the booking form through a mobile phone, the label for Date sometimes displays above the input field, sometimes displays to the side. There appears to be no pattern to what causes this bug. This has been tested on Chrome, Firefox and Safari and the issue seems to appear more frequently on Chrome.
- When viewed on a mobile (browser dependant) the video container doesnt always render the full width of the screen. Again, this appears to be a Chrome issue.
