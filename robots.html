        The robots –
        In the attempt to keep human beings off the highly radiactive roofs of Chernobyl power plant, around 60 remote-control
        robots were used to remove the approximately 100tons of debris from the power plant’s 3 different roof sections. (Katya
        – 1000 roentgen per hour, Nina – 2000 roentgen per hour and Masha – 12000 roentgen per hour)
        
        The debris mainly consisted of rubble from the fabric of the building itself but also a large amount of graphite from
        the exploded core, this is what caused the horrifically high radiation levels on the 3 roof sections. Approximately 2
        hours on katya would be fatal, 1 hour on Nina and perhaps the most terrifying of all, 3 minutes stood on Masha in full
        protective gear would result in your painful demise.
        
        So, why so many robots for only 3 roof tops? The radiation. The scientists behind the clean up relied on all different
        kinds of robots, from police use to lunar rovers – most built in the Soviet Union itself. But none of them could
        withstand the intense Gamma radiation found on the roof. Even lead shielding provided little to no protection for the
        remote-controlled machines. Unfortunately, there was only one other kind of robot the scientists could rely on.

        Bio robots. –
        The morbidly named “bio-robots” were exactly what they sound like… People. Yes, approximately 3800 men (otherwise known
        as “liquidators”) were used to shovel (by hand) the debris from the roof, over the side and back into the exposed
        reactor core. But surely the robots before them took care of the majority of the debris? Sadly, no. The robots only
        managed to clear around 10% before humans took over and finished the job. The soldiers tasked with the job would wear
        heavy protective gear (This usually consisted of thick leather gowns/clothing with lead lined aprons and codpieces, gas
        masks and lead hoods) and were only allowed on the rooftop for 40-90 seconds. The liquidators were only supposed to do
        one run at the roof top but some men reported going on the roof 5 or six times.
        The brave men who shoveled debris absorbed on average 25rem (250mSv) of radiation. Bear in mind – The annual limit for
        radiation exposure to the general public is 1 mSv per year.
        
        Not only were people tasked with clearing up the rooftop of the plant, but also the surrounding area, deep into the
        exclusion zone (radius of 30 kilometers). Their tasks would vary from levelling forests, digging up the topsoil and
        burying it within itself, disposing of domesticated and wild animals, clearing food from abandoned buildings, and
        spraying “bourda” – a thick slop designed to bind radioactive materials and wash away contamination.
        
        To list everything the liquidators did would be impossible, all in around 240 000 recovery workers were called upon in
        1986 and 1987 alone. In total approximately 600 000 men and women risked their lives to keep contamination low and stop
        the spread of Radiation across the world. What became of them? Today – around 25 000 are dead and 70 000 disabled. The
        sacrifice these heroes took is something we can never thank them enough for and a debt that will never be repaid.
