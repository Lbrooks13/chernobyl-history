        <h3>
          On April 26th 1986 - A routine test resulted in the worst radiological
          accident the world had ever seen.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Caused by a terrible combination of user error, Soviet secrets, inflated
          egos and cut corners, 1:23am was the moment the world would never be
          the same again. Lets take a dive into the incident and uncover what
          went wrong at Chernobyl - Reactor 4, see who and what was used to clean up
          the mess and reflect on what is now left of the irradiated wasteland.
        </p>
        <ul id="ul-a">
          <li>
            The amount of radiation released was 200 times higher than the atomic bombs that hit Nagasaki and Hiroshima during World War 2.
          </li>
          <li>
            Radioactive rain fell as far away as Ireland, but was detected in Wales, Sweden and all over Europe. Sweden was the first country to detect the radiation coming from Chernobyl.
          </li>
          <li>
            The open reactor was releasing such high levels of radiation that if you were able to stand next to it, you would be dead within 40 seconds.
          </li>
        </ul>
