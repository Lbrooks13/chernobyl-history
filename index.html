    <h3>
      On April 26th 1986 a routine test resulted in the worst radiological
      accident the world had ever seen.
    </h3>

    <p>
      Caused by a terrible combination of user error, Soviet secrets, inflated
      ego's and cut-corners, 1:23am was the moment the world would never be the
      same again. Let's take a dive into the incident and uncover what went
      wrong at Chernobyl - Reactor 4, see who/what was used to clean up the mess
      and what is now left of the irradiated waste-land.
