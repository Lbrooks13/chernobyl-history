      <h3>
        On April 26th - 1986 a routine test resulted in the worst radiological
        accident the world had ever seen.
      </h3>

      <p>
        Caused by a terrible combination of user error, Soviet secrets, inflated
        ego's and cut-corners, 1:23am was the moment the world would never be
        the same again. Let's take a dive into the incident and uncover what
        went wrong at Chernobyl - Reactor 4, see who/what was used to clean up
        the mess and what is now left of the irradiated waste-land.
